      <h1>on posting!, your posts are private and yours only</h1>
      <h2>who can read your posts?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>the short answer? <em>only you</em>.</li>
        <li>
          the longer answer: posting! <em>does not</em> send your posts to our
          servers. if this ever changes, the app will explain and ask before
          sharing any data.
        </li>
        <li>
          all posts are saved locally to your iCloud Drive, similarly to how
          <em>apple’s notes app works</em>. you can read about how

          >, but the short answer is that it’s
          <em>encrypted in transit and rest</em>.
          <p>
            it’s incredibly difficult for apple to read your posts, and
            <em>impossible for me</em> to read your posts.

      <h2 id="export">how to access and export your data</h2>

          built-in
